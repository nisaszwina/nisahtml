<P>After completing my matriculation, I worked as a<B> babysitter</B> in the area near my house for two months. It was a very valuable experience because it taught me many new lessons.</P>

<P>Through this experience, I learned how to control my emotions better, interact with children, and understand their needs. It also taught me about responsibility, patience, and the importance of communication skills in daily life. I also learned how to organize a daily schedule and manage my time effectively, as being a babysitter required careful planning to meet the child’s needs.</P>

<P>In addition, I learned to solve problems calmly, especially when facing unexpected situations. This experience allowed me to grow in terms of my personality and social skills, which will be useful for my future.</P>

<P>Currently, I work as a <B>cashier </B>at the Entrepreneurship Club (KUSDO) in Kolej Dato Onn. This experience has given me the opportunity to develop my financial management skills and customer interaction. As a cashier, I have learned to manage transactions carefully, ensuring that all payments are processed smoothly and accurately.</P>

<P>Additionally, I have learned how to deal with different types of customers and improve my communication skills. This experience has also taught me about teamwork, as I need to cooperate with my colleagues to ensure that operations run efficiently. I’ve also been able to improve my time management skills, as working as a cashier requires me to work quickly and handle busy situations.</P>
